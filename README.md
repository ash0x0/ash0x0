### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a guy who enjoys learning, figuring out seemingly complex stuff, and building cool things.
On the side, I'm a software engineer who enjoys being hands-on with every single part of the stack.
Be it frontend, backend, DevOps, SRE, Data Engineering, DevXP, etc. Whatever comes across my way on the journey to build something new.
I also love studying organizations and learning about how the world works. So I'm almost done with my MBA because I thought that'd help (it surprisingly did).
Mostly though, I enjoy reading the most. Economics, busienss, philosophy, sociology, and whatever else I deem interesting.

See my [resume](./ahmed_elshafey_resume.pdf).
